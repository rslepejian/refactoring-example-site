# Horiseon Homepage Refactor

This project involved refactoring the Horiseon Homepage to make the page's files easier to
understand and to add accesibility in the form of a webpage title and image alt messages. Many of
the html semantic tags were changed to make their roles clearer, including changing generic "div" to "aside."
Many redundant classes with the same purpose were combined to reduce clutter.
